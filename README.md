# Book Catalog API

This is a RESTful API for managing a book catalog, allowing you to perform operations like adding new books, retrieving books, and managing author details. The API is built using Django and Django REST Framework.

## Features

- **Author Management**: Add and retrieve authors for books.
- **Book Management**: Add new books, retrieve information about existing books, and manage details.
- **Image Uploads**: Supports image uploads for book covers.
- **Authentication**: Basic authentication to secure certain API endpoints.
- **Pagination**: Retrieve paginated lists of books and authors for easier navigation.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or above
- Django 5.1 or above
- Django REST Framework
- Pillow (for image handling)

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bookcatalogapi.git
   cd bookcatalogapi
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS/Linux:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Apply Migrations**:

   Set up the database by running the migrations:

   ```

5. **Create a Superuser** (Optional, for Admin Panel):

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Endpoints

### **1. Author Endpoints**

- **GET /api/authors/**: Get a list of all authors.
- **POST /api/authors/**: Add a new author.

### **2. Book Endpoints**

- **GET /api/books/**: Get a list of all books.
- **POST /api/books/**: Add a new book to the catalog (includes support for book cover image).
- **GET /api/books/{id}/**: Get detailed information about a specific book.
- **PUT /api/books/{id}/**: Update a book's details.
